However, given the p-value <.0001, it says that probability that the two samples are the same given this data is very very low. So, we can reject this null hypothesis at the alpha = .01 level. These samples are not the same, and combined with our descriptive statistics, we know that the mean/median for the rain data are higher than that of the not_rain data."

    "If you decide to use to two separate plots for the two histograms, please ensure that the x-axis limits for both of the plots are identical. It is much easier to compare the two in that case.\n",
    "For the histograms, you should have intervals representing the volume of ridership (value of ENTRIESn_hourly) on the x-axis and the frequency of occurrence on the y-axis. For example, each interval (along the x-axis), the height of the bar for this interval will represent the number of records (rows in our data) that have ENTRIESn_hourly that falls in this interval.\n",
    "Remember to increase the number of bins in the histogram (by having larger number of bars). The default bin width is not sufficient to capture the variability in the two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 One visualization can be more freeform. You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class (e.g., scatter plots, line plots) or attempt to implement something more advanced if you'd like. Some suggestions are:\n",
